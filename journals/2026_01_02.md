		- Woman: Did you see all the reviews for our new movie yet?
		- Man: Yeah, I was really hoping it would be a hit, but it seems like it didn't live up to he hype at all.
		- Woman: I know, it's like a slap in the face.
		- Woman: Remember that zero-gravity fight scene we worked on for weeks?
		- Woman: Critics called it "uninspired".
		- Man: Exactly. All those long nights of editing to make the CGI look realistic, and what for?
		- Man: To be left high and dry with a 2-star rating.
		- Woman: I guess we might have expected too much.
		- Woman: I had a feeling our marketing team oversold it, making the trailers promise more than we delivered.
		- Man: Possibly.
		- Man: It's so crushing to have your hopes dashed after putting in our absolute best.
		- Woman: Reason tells me we should learn from this, but the reality is we won't be financially okay for another attempt.
		- Man: So what should we do now?
		- Woman: Hmm... We need to take a step back and assess our options carefully.
		- Woman: There might be a way to make our old unfinished projects into something new.
