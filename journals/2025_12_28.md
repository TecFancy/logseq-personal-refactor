			- My friend Sandy has been in a long-distance relationship for three years.
			- A few months ago, her boyfriend, Emmett, moved in with her. And now it seems their relationship is **on the rocks**.
			- I always admired my friend's relationship. Long distance is hard, but they seemed pretty **content**.
			- My friend also has a lot of hobbies, and had lots of time for her interests. It seemed like a very **beneficial** situation for her.
			- But now things have changed. Emmett isn't as active as she is, and likes to spend time at home together.
			- And their schedules are different, too. My friend likes to go to bed early, but her boyfriend like to stay up late.
			- They've wanted to live together for a long time. But this situation is not something that they planned **for**.
			- Still, I hope they're **patient** with each other.
			- It takes time to build a relationship. It would be sad if they just threw it away.
